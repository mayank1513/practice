Mergr sorting of 10000 numbers took 0.000000msec.

Theoretical Time compexity of Merge Sort is n*log(n)=92103.403720


Selection Sorting of 10000 numbers took 265.000000msec

Theoretical Time compexity of Selection Sort is n^2=100000000


Insertion sorting of 10000 numbers took 328.000000msec.

Theoretical Time compexity of Insertion Sort is n*n,(for worst case)=100000000
